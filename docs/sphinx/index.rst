Athelas: Astrophysical Transients with Hydrodynamics and Emission using a Lagrangian Arbitrary order Scheme
===========================================================================================================

`Athelas`_ is a modern radiation hydrodynamics code for simulating astrophysical transients.


Key Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Gray two moment radiation transport
* Lagrangian hydrodynamics
* High order discontinuous Galerkin methods
* Fully coupled IMEX time integration
* Radioactive heating from Nickel and Cobalt decay including gammas and positrons.
* Saha ionization with feedback into the equation of state
* Shared memory parallelism with `Kokkos`_
